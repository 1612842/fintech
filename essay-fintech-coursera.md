# Summary course

## Definition of fintech

-   There are different definitions depending on your perspective
-   You can think of how you view FinTech as being biased or colored depending on your background your perspective, where you're coming from
-   We're going to look at this from four different perspectives and defining what is FinTech:
    -   Traditional Large Financial Firms - Dinosaurs
        -   There is nothing new
        -   Financial firms have used technology to improve service for a long time
            -    technology made things more efficient
            -    technology changed how fast transactions are processed 
            -    information searching -  find which information is relevant -  which information can be trusted, and what to do with this information
            -    `in the 70s, or the 80s, which Paul Volcker said was the best FinTech technology ever developed, is an ATM`
        - **FinTech is basically financial institutions using technology to improve their processes, TechFin is technology institutions providing financial services Think Alibaba, Alipay, Tencent, etc.**
        -  When we think of FinTech today even though technology has been used by financial institutions for centuries we associate it mainly with the big giants from China that have totally revolutionized the financial markets in China
        -    The business model of a lot of these platforms is about making money out of data, in other words data monetization
        -    Some banks can win or lose overtime, it can be the wrong bet on the wrong technology but it not the only reason that banks may fail: sometimes they merge, sometimes there's financial crisis, sometimes they don't get bailed out by the government
  
    -   Startup & FinTech entrepreneurs
        - IT & Banking:
          -  IT has always served a critical role in banking
          -   Financial data was closed: 
                -   Now: opening Banking API
                -   can use my ATM card at many ATMs for many banks and they interchange with each other and to transact with each other
        - Trading:
          - Direct connections to exchange:
            - Used to have to be a member
            - Now just have to comply with a regulation
          - Dependence on traditional banking reduced
        - Regulation:
          - Regulation can be good or bad
          - Cybersecurity was and is a big issue
          - Level playing for all users
        - Who control the data?
          - Checks and balance
          - Trust but verify

          - End-user computing
            - Data extraction
            - Customization
          - Online services
            - Loans and financing
            - Lower fee overall
            - Managing IT people is hard
            - Bank is starting to fund fintech companies
              - Lower risk
              - Different approach to innovation
        - Understanding consumer :
            - Many companies struggle to understand their consumers
            - Media consumptions is very different nowadays
        - Banking tomorrow
          - "We will always need banking, but will not always need banks"
          - Banking service must evolve 
            - Business model 
            - Innovation model
            - Technology model
            - Data management
        - One of the biggest challenges you see today is there are so many opportunities that you have to turn down a lot of innovations, ideas, opportunities And you have to figure out what am I going to focus on and what am I going to do, because there's just a huge wealth of opportunities in Fintech 
  
    -   FinTech investors 
        - Cryptocurrencies as an investment
          - In the future when people talk about their investment they will mention crypto
        - Investment for the new generation:
          - Young people are more likely to get into crypto
            - It's related to tech 
            - In general they are less risk adverse
            - Stock vs crypto
        - Crypto market speed
          - Thing move fast in the world of crypto
            - Fast profit
            - Fast losses
        - General investment strategy
          - It's a combination of long-term bets and very short-term ones
            - Earning revenue today
            - Building system for the future
    -   FinTech consumers
        -   Fintech revolution:
            -   Convenient and ease of use is king
            -   New ways of doing business opens up new doors
            -   New interactions with companies lead to new opportunities
            -   We want convenience We want to be able to trade anywhere We want to be able to buy and sell things We want to be able to move money around from one account to another We want what WeChat can offer in China or we want what Apple can provide us or what PayPal can provide us
            -    As a consumer, this is a proliferation of flexible convenient, attractive offerings that I could never have without this FinTech revolution 
            -    Ten years ago, Apple brought out the iPhone In that time, banks have become more inward looking and tech firms have developed a proliferation of applications An explosion of applications that mean consumers look to and trust Amazon Alipay, Tencent, eBay, PayPal as much or more than they do their banks 
            -    They like Amazon They don't like their bank because Amazon is convenient Amazon is fast. Amazon as easy The bank is trouble
            -    `We want easy, fast, convenient powerful, flexible, adaptable, innovative`
   - Case study - Capital one:
     - New way of doing banking:
       - Focus on the most profitable customers: highest returns and lower risks
       - Ulitize data Mining/Big Data
     - Started to expand traditional banking
       - Mortgages
       - Real-estate
     - 2008 Sub-prime Crisis hit them hard
     - Went from innovator to copy-cat
     - They went back to core competency:
       - Stumbled but recovered
       - 10th Largest Bank in USA by assets
       - Started from the bottom and transformed the industry
  
    -   Summary:
        -  Different perspectives based on different backgrounds, different expectations
        -   Defining FinTech is complex because it means different things to different people And so what you define it as depends on how you're approaching it
        -   "What's new is smartphones. What's new is the iPhone and the Samsung and others, Android phones because that puts at your fingertips capability you never had before for computing technology and it changes consumers' view and interaction with many things in their world."
        -    If I were to look at the perspective of the large firms we would say FinTech is not new.  We can argue that we've been using technology and finance for more than 100 years of different types of technology, different perspectives
        -    We talked about a consumer perspective I'm going a little bit out of order but in terms of the opportunity this is enabled by consumers expecting new things it's not enabled by tech FinTech is not necessarily about new finance or new tech It's about new attitudes towards apps new attitudes towards convenience
        -    when you think about this perspective of the CEO it's useful to look and say What the heck is going on and what are the new startups? And there are many, many many new businesses being started up So this is a proliferation of opportunity you've got to hear from one CEO But there are hundreds of FinTech CEOs starting up new businesses and new opportunities Some of which are just joining in the bandwagon and maybe they're just fraud or maybe they're noise or maybe they will fail
        -    And finally, from the perspective of investors this is a roller coaster. They're enjoying the ups and downs. And some investor enthusiasm about FinTech is simply that it is so volatile. Just like people go to a casino for a reason Not because they want to lose their money They will, probably on average and maybe some of this is going to result in losses but maybe some of it will and has resulted in wealth 

## Application of fintech - finance side

### Lending and personal finance

### Crowdfunding & business financing

### Payments and retail transactions

### Equity, trading, and investment

### Cryptocurrencies

### Banking infrastructure tools, and logistics

### Summary


- They're related to or part of the application space of FinTech as broadly perceived They're not consumer oriented, they're not small business oriented, but they are going to enable Fundamental changes in our society and fundamental changes in how we deliver financial services into the future

## Tech of FinTech

### Identity, Privacy, and Anonymity
- Identity in physical world
  - Identity is important in many ways both online and in the physical world
  - Privacy matters in some contexts and societies 
    - Tradeoffs and Challenges
  - Anonimity sometimes is important in traditional and online contexts
  - Identity is important
    - Fundamental requirement of secure financial transactions
  - Identity in ancient times
  - Changes in society today
  - What if no identity proof?
    - Inefficiencies
    - Fraud
  - Providing Physical Identity:
    - Signature
    - ID/Picture/Magnetic Strip
      - Invented in 1960 by IBM
      - Most common ID today
    - Password
    - Fingerprint/Biometrics
    - Documents/Paper
  - Does this work online? 
- Identity in a digital world
  - Provide identity
    - Picture/facial recognition
    - Password
    - Fingerprint/Biometrics, linked with smartphones
    - Social media connection
    - Secure Crypto ID (PKI)
  - Tradeoff
    - Security vs convenience
- Digital transaction needs:
  - Transactions between trusted IT systems
  - Conversion of physical currency to digital currency and back
  - Transactions between anonymous individuals in a trusted IT environment
  - Transaction between anonymous individuals in an "intrusted" cyber environment. The most challenging is sometimes we want to do transactions between people who don't know each other in an environment where they don't trust each other Then what's cool about bitcoin and some of the cryptocurrencies is we can now do trusted transactions between people who have no reason to trust each other over systems that have no trusted intermediary We can use the technology to create the trust for the transaction without knowing the identity of the people or the identity systems involved What we do identify is the assets involved and transacted So, we may not need to have identity of people, we may have identity of wallets and coins that substitute for identity of individuals maintaining a level of security and privacy and anonymity that would be difficult in a physical space
### Blockchain and encryption
- Blockchain:
  - Linked and secured blocks using cryptography
  - No need for trusted third party - all public
  - Block: A continously growing list of records

- Encryption:
  - Property of one-way function:
    - fixed length output
    - small change new hash
    - easy to compute
    - distributed uniformly
    - use can only invert hash funtion by brute force

- Application of hash function
  - Allow one to commit to a chosen value
  - Hide it from others, and can reveal the commit value later
  - The party cannot change the value after they commit to it

- Document integrity:
  - Checksum procedure:
    - When you download a file from a website, it can provide a SHA-256 hash
    - After download the file, you can compute the hash and compare with one published on the website

- Password storage
  - Website often store passwords of clients in hashed form
  - Password store this way cannot be recovered and has to change if lost


- DLT is more than Blockchain, Blockchain is more than Bitcoin, Bitcoin is an application. DLT and encryption are critical to many aspects of FinTech, not just Blockchain, many other areas use encryption use distributed ledger, but Blockchain clearly demonstrated DLT works

### Big Data and analytics

### AI, DSS, and Automation

### Smartphones and customer tech

### Summary

- We've looked at the technology or capabilities for identity, privacy and anonymity, being able to maintain a unique identity in some cases while still maintaining privacy and anonymity

-  We've looked at Blockchain and encryption, and associated technologies distributed ledger, and how do those enable or create new opportunities in FinTech context 

- We've looked at big data and analytics and the role that that plays in creating opportunities as well as creating new capabilities for firms to leverage in both existing firms large firms, and small
-  We've looked at AI, DSS, expert systems and automation as related technologies in enabling new ways of doing finance doing banking, and issuing some different challenges for the industry than what we had historically thought of as the role of automation in variety of industries
-  And we've looked at smartphones and other types of consumer tech and how those have changed our world

## Implications for established business

### Why FinTech is a threat?

- a quote from Bill Gates Who said, we will always need banking, but we may not always need banks

- The rises of fintech is closely associated with the rise of China:
  - Alibank/Alipay
  - Ant Financial
  - Wechat wallet

- China has over 60% FinTech adoption rates China has the world's largest money market fund owned by Alibaba, a tech company China has WeBank, and WeChat and WeWallets WePayment wallets, from Tencent, another tech firm that links and has become the primary interface to finance for many people across the nation of China

- Reverse consumer trends is going to be difficult
- In western countries, like the US or Europe, we see slower adoption Because the banking infrastructure and capabilities are better 
-  it is a threat when it moves too fast, when it becomes disruptive If the banks don't have time to respond, they may lose the customer, traditional firms will find themselves in hot water
-  Fintech still relative young, but there are thousand of fintech out there

- it's harder to regain a customer once lost this is why FinTech is a threat

- the last 10 years for banks have been lackluster
- the last 10 years for tech firms have been full of growth
- tech firm have more access to capital

- Wrap up:
  - There will be winners and losers
    - There will be a lot of failures, this is the nature of a disruptive technological area
    - The winner will become lions that will overpower "tradtional mode" companies

### Global trends

### Strategies for banks and insurance companies

- Hope 
  - Hope that regulations will kill or slow down fintech  
    - Bitcoin in China
    - Block ICOs, exchanges
  - Innovative entrepreneurs will find a way though
- Buy
  - Buy FinTech successes
    - Expensive and hard to justify to shareholders
    - Very high price (possible bidding war)
    - Culture clash - may lose key founders
- Create
  - Create your own fintech subsidiaries or firms
    - When technology matures you can copy what the pioneers have done relatively easily
- Incubate
  - Incubators/Sandbox
    - Invest in or encourage startups using venture capital
    - Dont have to own everything, dont have to control every thing, still get many benefits
- Partner
  - Partnership/Collaboration
    - Visa and MasterCard payment systems. MasterCard founded by six banks is a collaborative venture and a joint stockholding company asking other banks to join in swift collaborative partnering of banks to be able to do transactions in the back-end many many different ways banks have collaborated in the past 
    - Partnering with tech firms more stable than owning a tech firm
      - WeBank Wallet. They may be more happy to have you as a customer or partner or data provider or customer and regulatory compliance partner aid to their business model than they had to have you own them because they can still have a high valuation and you don't have to pay that valuation You are leveraging the success of their company WeBank in China is growing by leaps and bounds
      - You don't lose the customer necessarily as long as you're transparent friendly and the customer says my bank works nicely with my cell phone app and I don't feel any need to change They work together.
      - That's sustainable and could be an intriguing business model
